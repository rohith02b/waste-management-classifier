# This workflow will build and push an application Azure Container Registry
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# For instructions see:

#
# 1. Set the following secrets in your repository (instructions for getting these can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli%2Clinux):
#    - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
#    - AZURE_TENANT_ID
#    - AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
#
# 2. Set the following environment variables (or replace the values below):
#    - AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY (name of your container registry / ACR)
#    - CONTAINER_NAME (name of the container image you would like to push up to your ACR)
#    - CONTAINER_TAG (docker image tag)
#    - PROJECT_PATH (base path of the project in the repo)
#    - RESOURCE_GROUP (where your cluster is deployed)
#    - DOCKERFILE (path of the dockerfile)
